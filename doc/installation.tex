\chapter{Installation}

\label{inst}
Before the installation of dugksFoam, you should have installed the OpenFOAM together with the ThirdParty tools on your Linux machine.
The download address of OpenFOAM and the detailed installation instructions can found in the
\href{http://openfoam.org/download/}{official web site of OpenFOAM} and the ~\href{https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Main_Page}{OpenFOAM wiki}.
The OpenFOAM versions I have tested is 2.2.1, 2.3.0 and 2.4.0.
But the dugksFoam should also works on the latest release of OpenFOAM (Ver.~3.0.0 or above).

The detailed installation instructions are as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Load the OpenFOAM environment:
Type the command \texttt{ofxxx} where \texttt{xxx} is the three digits of the OpenFOAM version you installed,
if you have followed the official installation instructions of OpenFOAM. For example, \texttt{of240} or \texttt{of230}.
\item Create your own solvers installation location, and cd to it :
\begin{verbatim}
mkdir -p $FOAM_RUN/../applications
cd $FOAM_RUN/../applications
\end{verbatim}
\item Get the source code using git (see below) from \href{https://github.com/zhulianhua/dugksFoam}{dugksFoam repository}
or download it as a ZIP package by clicking \href{https://github.com/zhulianhua/dugksFoam/archive/master.zip}{here}.
\begin{itemize}
\item If using git:
\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/zhulianhua/dugksFoam.git
cd dugksFoam/src
\end{verbatim}
\item If installing by ZIP package, move the ZIP package (\texttt{dugksFoam-master.zip}) to \verb|$FOAM_RUN/../applications|. Then unzip it by
\begin{verbatim}
unzip dugksFoam-master.zip
mv dugksFoam-master dugksFoam
cd dugksFoam/src
\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

\item For OpenFOAM release older than 2.4.0, there is a compatible issue in the make file options about \verb|meshTool|.
If you are using OpenFOAM older than 2.4.0, fix it by this command:
\begin{verbatim}
git apply PatchMeshToolIssue
\end{verbatim}

\item Change the compier from CXX to MPICXX, because we implemented the velocity-space parallel feature which use the standard alone MPI instead of the Pstream library of OpenFOAM. As sometime we can not mofify the global wmake option, here we make a our own copy of the offical wmake script, and then overrite the CC defination for make (only tested on OpenFOAM 2.4.0): 

\begin{verbatim}
    cp `which wmake` .
    sed -i '316s/makeType/makeType CC=mpicxx/' wmake
\end{verbatim}

%
%\begin{verbatim}cp $WM_DIR/rules/$WM_ARCH$WM_COMPILER/c++ \
%    $WM_DIR/rules/$WM_ARCH$WM_COMPILER/c++.bak
%sed -i "s/$WM_CXX/mpicxx/"  \
%    $WM_DIR/rules/$WM_ARCH$WM_COMPILER/c++ 
%\end{verbatim}

\item Compile the dugksFoam by:
\begin{verbatim}
./Allwmake
\end{verbatim}

\item Check if the compilation is OK:
\begin{verbatim}
which dugksFoam
\end{verbatim}
It should tell you where the compiled executable \verb|dugksFoam| is.
\end{enumerate}
